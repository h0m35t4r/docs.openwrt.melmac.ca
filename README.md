# The openwrt.melmac.ca packages documentation

This is documentation for packages for OpenWrt devices created/maintained under the Melmac Open Source Software Development Foundation (MOSSDeF). While some of these are packages are already available from official OpenWrt release/snapshots repositories/feeds, [the ipk packages repo](https://repo.openwrt.melmac.ca)/[the apk packages repo](https://apk.openwrt.melmac.ca) usually contain newer versions. You can also browse/check-out the [source code](https://source.openwrt.melmac.ca).

### <a name='OnyourOpenWrtdevice'></a>On your OpenWrt device

#### <a name='OnyourOpenWrtdevicewithopkg'></a>On your OpenWrt device with opkg

The ipk binaries repository is currently hosted at [GitHub](https://github.com). If you have problems accessing [my ipk packages repo](https://repo.openwrt.melmac.ca) or access to [GitHub](https://github.com) may be blocked at the location where your router is installed, skip to the [Add OPKG/IPK repository to your OpenWrt device (jsDelivr)](#add-opkgipk-repository-to-your-openwrt-device-jsdelivr) section. Both repositories use HTTPS protocol and require one of the SSL support packages to be installed on your router.

##### Add OPKG/IPK repository to your OpenWrt device (GitHub)

```sh
opkg update
opkg install wget-ssl
echo -e -n 'untrusted comment: OpenWrt usign key of Stan Grishin\nRWR//HUXxMwMVnx7fESOKO7x8XoW4/dRidJPjt91hAAU2L59mYvHy0Fa\n' > /etc/opkg/keys/7ffc7517c4cc0c56
sed -i '/stangri_repo/d' /etc/opkg/customfeeds.conf
echo 'src/gz stangri_repo https://repo.openwrt.melmac.ca' >> /etc/opkg/customfeeds.conf
opkg update
```

##### Add OPKG/IPK repository to your OpenWrt device (jsDelivr)

```sh
opkg update
opkg install wget-ssl
echo -e -n 'untrusted comment: OpenWrt usign key of Stan Grishin\\nRWR//HUXxMwMVnx7fESOKO7x8XoW4/dRidJPjt91hAAU2L59mYvHy0Fa\\n' > /etc/opkg/keys/7ffc7517c4cc0c56
sed -i '/stangri_repo/d' /etc/opkg/customfeeds.conf
echo 'src/gz stangri_repo https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stangri/repo.openwrt.melmac.ca' >> /etc/opkg/customfeeds.conf
opkg update
```

Please note that there may be delay in [jsDelivr CDN](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stangri/repo.openwrt.melmac.ca) cache updates comparing to [my packages repo at GitHub](https://repo.openwrt.melmac.ca) which may cause `opkg` to pull older files and/or complain about wrong signature.

#### <a name='OnyourOpenWrtdevicewithapk'></a>On your OpenWrt device with apk

The apk binaries repository is currently hosted at [GitHub](https://github.com). If you have problems accessing [my apk packages repo](https://apk.openwrt.melmac.ca) or access to [GitHub](https://github.com) may be blocked at the location where your router is installed, skip to the [Add APK repository to your OpenWrt device (jsDelivr)](#add-apk-repository-to-your-openwrt-device-jsdelivr) section. Both repositories use HTTPS protocol and require one of the SSL support packages to be installed on your router.

##### Add APK repository to your OpenWrt device (GitHub)

```sh
echo 'https://apk.openwrt.melmac.ca/packages.adb' > /etc/apk/repositories.d/apk.openwrt.melmac.ca.list
wget https://apk.openwrt.melmac.ca/apk.openwrt.melmac.ca.pem -O /etc/apk/keys/apk.openwrt.melmac.ca.pem
